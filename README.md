# brainpyck
Fully-working small Brainfuck interpreter written in Python

Written in ~30 minutes.

Also it fits in 50 lines of code (with empty lines for readability)
# What brainpyck can do?
Everything that other interpreters can. All 8 commands working nice. The only limitation is the interpreter haas only 10 cells, but if you need more - just change this in code (cellCount).
# How I should use it?
Just open console and type

python brainpyck.py \<brainfuck program file\>
  
Thats it.
# Does it have any bugs/glitches?
I really dont know. I think yes but i didn't found any. I tested many programs and all of them have worked nice.

P.S. deadfish interpreter written in brainfuck doenst works somewhy
# I found a bug! What i should do?
Just create a new issue, or pull request (if you know how to solve that)
